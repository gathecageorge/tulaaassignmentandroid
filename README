1. Clone this repository:

2. This is an android studio project: Open with android studio and compile to create APK.
Otherwise you can use the APK here to install in any phone.

3. Copy the sample CSV file to any folder on the phone. It will be used to test uploading.

4. Run the app. When launched, There is a button to choose CSV. click on it to open file chooser.
Choose the sample CSV from respective folder.

5. In the Url textbox, type the url of the backend service that consumes the CSV file and stores it
inside the database.
Note: The phone and server backend needs to be on same network on the backend service be in the
internet.
In this case I use same network so the url is http://192.168.1.106:8080/csv using IP address
of the machine running backend at spring's default port 8080.

6. Click upload CSV, you will get response below the upload button.
